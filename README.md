# Welcome to the Azure Resource Manager Toolkit!
Here you will find a collection of PowerShell modules designed to make your life working with ARM a bit easier.

Please feel free to submit fixes and enhancements via the GitHub pull request system. You can reach me directly at timothywarner316@gmail.com. Thanks for stopping by!

## New-ARMNamingConvention
This PowerShell function generates an Azure Resource Manager naming convention in accordance with best practices and and naming limitations.

### Usage
The function has two mandatory parameters:

* **Project**: Your project ID must begin with a letter and contain no more than four characters
* **Environment**: You can specify Development, Staging, Testing, or Production

Here's an example showing partial output:

```
PS C:\>New-ARMNamingConvention -Project 'plur' -Environment 'Development'

Name DisplayName       Type Value          
    
rg   Resource Group    PaaS plur-18-rg-dev 
vm   Virtual Machine   IaaS plur-18-vm-dev 
st   Storage Account   IaaS plur18stdev   
```
In the above output, the **18** represents a two-digit hexadecimal identifier. As you know, some Azure resources need to be globally unique.

Notice the storage account's format; this defers to the (frustrating) limitations of lowercase, alphanumeric storage account names with no intervening hyphens or underscores.

You are limited to a maximum of four characters for your project name. Don't get angry! Azure has a 15-character requirement for virtual machine names, so I applied that 15-character maximum to all these proposed resource names. Better safe than sorry!

### TODO
* Finish comment-based help
* Include additional Azure resources
* Organize the IaaS and PaaS categories
* Incorporate Pester tests
* Add functionality to the output object
